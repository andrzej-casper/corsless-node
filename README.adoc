= CORS-less Node

Run reverse proxy to avoid CORS error while calling Casper nodes from browser.

== Requirements

- docker
- curl
- jq

== Usage

If you want to proxy specific node:

[source,bash]
====
$ ./run.sh 135.181.216.142 7777
====

Alternatively, you can get node picked randomly among `mainnet` and `testnet`:

[source,bash]
====
$ ./run.sh testnet
====

After successful launch, proxy container will be running in background (with auto restart), but it might be stopped and removed:

[source,bash]
====
$ docker stop corsless-casper-node
$ docker rm corsless-casper-node
====

== Notes

You can get list of connected peers from any node. You can also visit https://casper.onrender.com/[this helper tool].
